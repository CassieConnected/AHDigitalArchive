## About the *Apartheid Heritage(s)* Collection

This collection of digital resources is an extension of the 3D spatial historical analysis of Soweto, the historic Black township near Johannesburg, South Africa.
The items in this collection were selected to encourage researchers to reimagine spaces by asking themseleves questions such as: 

- what is spatial history?
- are space and place the same thing?
- how do spaces influence and affect places?
