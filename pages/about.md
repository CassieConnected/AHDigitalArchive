## About the *Apartheid Heritage(s)* Collection

This collection of digital resources is an extension of the 3D spatial historical analysis of Soweto, the historic Black township near Johannesburg, South Africa.
The items in this collection were selected to encourage researchers to reimagine spaces by asking themseleves questions such as: 

- what is spatial history?
- are space and place the same thing?
- how do spaces influence and affect places?

## Using the *Apartheid Heritage(s)* Digital Archive

We want you to explore these digital objects and consider their history from a critical perspective. 

Feel free to explore the archive by searching for objects by specific metadata categories, such as:
-subject
-date
-location

# (Each included file has several options, which are documented in the files themselves. I've given the content widths of 25% and 50% to save space, but you can feature the entire image or document.) 

# - Image --> `{% raw %}{% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="demo_001" width="25" %}{% endraw %}`

# {% include feature/item-figure.html objectid="demo_001" width="25" %}

# - PDF -- > `{% raw %}{% include feature/item-pdf-embed.html objectid="demo_002"  width="25" %}{% endraw %}`

# {% include feature/item-pdf-embed.html objectid="demo_002" width="25" %}

# - Video: `{% raw %}{% include feature/item-video-embed.html objectid="demo_004" %}{% endraw %}`

# {% include feature/item-video-embed.html objectid="demo_004" %}

# - Card -- > `{% raw %}{% include feature/card.html header="This is a Card" text="The card features an image from the collection as a cap" objectid="demo_004" width="25" centered=true %}{% endraw %}`

When viewing an object, please pay special attention to the description field. The descriptions have been carefully researched in order to provide a historical background and context to the object. 

After the description of every image, there is a statement that reads, "For additional context, please consider:" followed by a list of concepts and events. These have been included to encourage the user to think critically about the object they are viewing, the spatial history, and the critical role of digital archives in pushing against normative historical narratives.

# {% include feature/card.html header="This is a Card" text="The card features an image from the collection as a cap" objectid="demo_004" width="25" centered=true %}

# - Buttons -- > `{% raw %}{% include feature/button.html text="Button Link to Somewhere" link="https://collectionbuilder.github.io/" color="success" %}{% endraw %}`

# {% include feature/button.html text="Button Link to Somewhere" link="https://collectionbuilder.github.io/" color="success" centered=true %}

#{% include feature/alert.html text="This is an *alert* that 'warns' a user with centrally aligned text." color="warning" align="center"  %}

#- Modals -- > `{% raw %}{% include feature/modal.html button="This is a modal using a 'primary' colored button to invite clicking" title="when clicked:" text="A Modal will pop out a box with some more information" color="primary"  %}{% endraw %}`

#{% include feature/modal.html button="This is a modal using a 'primary' colored button to invite clicking" title="When clicked:" text="A Modal will pop out a box with some more information" color="primary"  %}

#We hope this makes it easier for site builders to develop the collection AND add interesting and engaging contextual information.
