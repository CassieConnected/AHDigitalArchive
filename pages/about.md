## About the Apartheid Heritage(s) Collection

This collection of digital resources is an extension of the 3D spatial historical analysis of Soweto, the historic Black township near Johannesburg, South Africa.
The items in this collection were selected to encourage researchers to reimagine spaces by asking themseleves questions such as: 

- what is spatial history?
- are space and place the same thing?
- how do spaces influence and affect places?

{% include feature/card.html header="Description example" text="This 1977 photo shows a member of the South African Police's Security Branch, which was a special task force formed for the explicit purpose of crushing anti-apartheid movements. On June 19, 1977, the one-year anniversary of the Soweto Uprising, officers patrolled Black townships, shooting bird-shot, tear gas, and ammunition into Black demonstrators and protesters. The SAP Security Branch officer wears a camouflage uniform and carries tear-gas launcher attached to what appears to be an assault style rifle, one of the many weapons and riot gear used by police. Behind him are other SAP officers and white South African onlookers.
